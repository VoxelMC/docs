## Components

Astro components are the basic building blocks of any Astro project. They are HTML-only templating components with no client-side runtime. You can spot an Astro component by its file extension: `.astro`. Read more about components in the [Astro Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) page.

## Islands

Islands is a frontend architecture that results in better frontend performance by helping you avoid monolithic JavaScript patterns and stripping all non-essential JavaScript from the page automatically. The technique that this architectural pattern builds on is also known as partial or selective hydration. In Astro, an “island” refers to any interactive UI component on the page.
